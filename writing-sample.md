## Machine Learning in Semi-Supervised Provider Risk Assessment

### Abstract:

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge semi-supervised machine learning techniques for risk assessment in BH provider claims data. Given the critical importance of accurately identifying high-risk providers in mental healthcare and the challenges posed by the largely unlabeled nature of claims data, our research explores a range of innovative approaches. We experiment with Deep Learning with Autoencoders, particularly focusing on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for their proficiency in learning data representations and handling unlabeled datasets. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are evaluated for their ability to capture relational data structures, essential in interconnected healthcare systems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are applied to generate synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity and imbalance. Self-training and Pseudo-labeling techniques are tested for their efficiency in utilizing model predictions to enhance training with limited labeled data. The potential of Transfer Learning and Pre-trained Models is explored to leverage existing large datasets for fine-tuning on our specific risk assessment task. Ensemble Learning and Multi-view Learning methods are employed to improve prediction robustness, while Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning approaches are scrutinized for their applicability in scenarios with minimal labeled examples. Active Learning strategies are incorporated to iteratively select informative data points for labeling in our resource-constrained environment. The adaptability of Reinforcement Learning in dynamic risk assessment scenarios is also investigated. Lastly, Hybrid Models that amalgamate various techniques, including deep learning and traditional statistical methods, are examined for their effectiveness in this domain. Our research provides a comparative analysis of these methodologies, offering insights into their applicability and effectiveness in the context of BH provider risk assessment, with the aim of enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of mental healthcare services.
